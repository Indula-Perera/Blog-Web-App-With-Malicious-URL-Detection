# Blog Web App with Malicious URL Detection

Welcome to the Blog Web App with Malicious URL Detection project. This web application is built using Next.js and Prisma, and it includes a feature for detecting potentially malicious URLs.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Development Server:**
   - First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
   - Run the development server with one of the following commands:

     ```
     npm run dev
     # or
     yarn dev
     # or
     pnpm dev
     ```

   Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the application.

2. **Prisma Configuration:**
   - Ensure that you have MongoDB set up for Prisma.
   - To configure Prisma, follow these steps:

     a. Create a `.env` file and add the following configurations:
     - Database connection link
     - Google and GitHub authentication IDs and secrets

     b. Install required packages:

     ```bash
     npm install @prisma/client @auth/prisma-adapter
     npm install prisma --save-dev
     ```

     c. Initialize Prisma with MongoDB as the datasource provider:

     ```bash
     npx prisma init --datasource-provider mongodb
     npx prisma generate
     ```

3. **Start Developing:**
   You are now ready to start developing your web application. You can edit the app/page.js file, and the page will automatically update as you make changes.
